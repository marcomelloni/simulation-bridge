# MATLAB agent

The MATLAB Agent is a Python-based connector designed to interface with MATLAB simulations through various methods. It provides the following functionalities:

- **Batch Simulation**: Executes predefined MATLAB routines with specified input parameters, collecting the final results upon completion.
- **Streaming Simulation (Agent-Based)**: Allows sending input once, with the output being received in real-time during the simulation.
- **Interactive Simulation**: Continuously exchanges data with MATLAB, reacting to new inputs during the simulation loop.

The MATLAB Agent is primarily built to integrate with the Simulation Bridge but can also be utilized by external systems via RabbitMQ exchange methods. Communication parameters and other settings must be defined in the YAML-based configuration file.

## Requirements

### Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Working Directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/INTO-CPS-Association/simulation-bridge.git
cd simulation-bridge
```

#### 2. Install Poetry and Create Virtual Environment

Ensure that Poetry is installed on your system. If it is not already installed, execute the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
pipx install poetry
```

Verify the installation by checking the Poetry version:

```bash
poetry --version
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry env activate
```

> **Important:**  
> The command `poetry env activate` does not automatically activate the virtual environment; instead, it prints the command you need to run to activate it.  
> You must copy and paste the displayed command, for example:

```bash
source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Verify that the environment is active by checking the Python path:

```bash
which python
```

#### 3. Install Project Dependencies

Run the following command to install all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
poetry install
```

#### 4. Install the MATLAB Engine API for Python

To connect MATLAB to the Simulation Bridge, you need to install the MATLAB Engine API within the Poetry environment. There are two possible methods to integrate Matlab engine into python virtual environment.

##### 4.1 Installation using in-built Python package

The Matlab installation comes with python pip package which can be used. Assuming you are using MATLAB R2024b and MacOS, execute the following commands:

```bash
cd /Applications/MATLAB_R2024b.app/extern/engines/python
poetry run python -m pip install .
```

> **Note:** Replace `MATLAB_R2024b.app` with the version of MATLAB installed on your system.

##### 5.2 Install pip package

There is a pip package named [matlabengine](https://pypi.org/project/matlabengine) for Matlab.
Each version of this package is meant for a specific version of Matlab. You can see the [matlabengine package history](https://pypi.org/project/matlabengine/#history) and select the compatible pip package. Install the package for `Matlab_R2024b` release.

```bash
pip install matlabengine==24.2.2
```

#### 5. Verify the MATLAB Engine Installation

To ensure the installation was successful, run:

```bash
poetry run python -c "import matlab.engine; print('MATLAB Engine is installed successfully')"
```

If everything is correct, you should see the message:

```
MATLAB Engine is installed successfully!
```

Ensure that the MATLAB Engine is properly installed and accessible within your Python environment before proceeding.

### Configuration

The configuration is specified in yaml format. A template file (`matlab_agent/config/config.yaml.template`) has been provided. It can be customized further.

Explanation on different fields of the yaml template is given below.

```yaml

```

## Usage

The agent requires a configuration file to run. You can start by copying the provided template and customizing it as needed.

### Getting Started

**Generate a configuration file template:**

```bash
poetry run matlab-agent --generate-config
```

This command creates a `config.yaml` file in your current directory. If the file already exists, it will not be overwritten.

**Generate Project Files:**

To create a complete set of template files for your MATLAB agent project:

```bash
poetry run matlab-agent --generate-project
```

This command creates the following structure in your current directory (existing files won't be overwritten):

```
.
├── config.yaml                 # Agent configuration settings
├── SimulationBatch.m           # Template for batch simulations
├── SimulationStreaming.m       # Template for streaming simulations
├── SimulationWrapperStreaming.m  # MATLAB class for streaming simulations
├── SimulationWrapperInteractive.m  # MATLAB class for interactive simulations
└── client/
  ├── simulation.yaml         # Example simulation request payload
  ├── use.yaml                # Client configuration file
  └── use_matlab_agent.py     # Client script to send requests
```

Each template file contains documentation and can be customized for your specific simulation requirements.

### Running the Agent

To start the MATLAB Agent with the default configuration:

```bash
poetry run matlab-agent
```

To use a custom configuration file:

```bash
poetry run matlab-agent --config-file <path_to_config.yaml>
```

Or use the shorthand:

```bash
poetry run matlab-agent -c <path_to_config.yaml>
```

## Distributing the Package as a PIP Package with Poetry

To create the package, run the following command in the project's root directory (where `pyproject.toml` is located):

```bash
poetry build
```

This will generate two files in the `dist/` folder:

- A `.whl` file → (Wheel Package).
- A `.tar.gz` file → (Source Archive).

Example output:

```bash
dist/
├── matlab_agent-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
└── matlab_agent-0.2.0.tar.gz
```

### Verifying the Package (Optional but Recommended)

You can verify that the package works by installing it locally:

```bash
pip install dist/matlab_agent-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Then, run the command defined in the script:

```bash
matlab-agent
```

### Releasing a New Version

When you modify the code and want to release a new version, increment the version number in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
version = "0.3.0"
```

Then rebuild the package:

```bash
poetry build
```

## Demonstration

For instructions on running tests created with `pytest` and `unittest.mock`, please refer to the [Tests Documentation](matlab_agent/tests/README.md).

## Quick Start: Interacting with the MATLAB Agent

To quickly get started, generate the default project structure by running:

```bash
poetry run matlab-agent --generate-project
```

This will create a `client/` directory in the root of your project containing all necessary files for interaction.

Next, move into the client directory:

```bash
cd client
```

Inside this folder, you'll find:

- `use.yaml` — Configuration file for the communication protocol (e.g., RabbitMQ settings)
- `simulation.yaml` — The simulation request payload that will be sent to the MATLAB Agent
- `use_matlab_agent.py` — Python script to send the request and receive the results

For detailed instructions on how to configure and use the client, refer to the [Use Matlab Agent](./matlab_agent/resources/README.md) in the `agents/matlab/matlab_agent/resources/` folder.

## Workflow

1. The agent connects to RabbitMQ and sets up the required queues and exchanges.
2. It listens for incoming messages on its dedicated queue.
3. Upon receiving a message:

- It analyzes and processes the simulation request.
- Executes the simulation.
- Sends the results to the output exchange.

For detailed information regarding simulations and constraints, please refer to the [Simulations and Constraints Documentation](matlab_agent/docs/README.md).

## Package Development

The developer-specific commands are

```bash
pytest
pylint matlab_agent
autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --recursive 'matlab_agent'
```
